**1. Introduction**

> **1.1 Project Motivation**

The goal of this project is to try and emulate a meteorologist (on a
small scale). It's on a small scale because my model will only be
capable of predicting if it will rain tomorrow. It unfortunately cannot
yet give you a full 7-day forecast. The overall intention is to produce
a model that can correctly predict with 80-90% accuracy, just like a
meteorologist.

> **1.2 Aims and Objectives**

The overall aim and objective of the project is to learn about the data
science field as a whole and effectively apply data science ideas within
the project. I learned a lot about R programming, data processing,
Apache Hadoop, logistic regression, and confusion matrix metrics.

Here are the steps that I used to organize and complete my project.

1.  Data Pre-processing in R

2.  MapReduce research and Java implementation

3.  Testing the model using a testing dataset

4.  Analysis using confusion matrix formulas

5.  Think about possible improvements by reflecting on the project and
    its results

> **1.3 Report Structure**

The final project contains a single R project (code for data processing)
and five separate Java classes (code for training and testing the
model). Three of the five Java classes are used for the MapReduce Job
where the model is being trained. More specifically, these three classes
are used in tandem to calculate and update the weights of the model.
These weights will later be used for classification and testing the
model. The three java classes are the map-reduce driver, mapper, and
reducer classes. The remaining two Java classes are used for testing the
model. More specifically, summing the number of correct and incorrect
predictions as well as determining if it was false positive, true
positive, false negative, or true negative. This information is vital
for testing the effectiveness of the model. This is further elaborated
on in the **Approach and Implementation (6)** and **Experiment Results
and Discussion (7)** sections of the report.

**2. Background/History of the Study**

It is no secret that weather can be predicted. There is an entire field
of study that is obsessed with this, meteorology. Meteorology has been
around for centuries; it's even older if you include the Greek
philosophers and thinkers observing the atmosphere and its patterns.
Meteorology and predicting weather were not technically a science until
1600s, when Torricelli invented theÂ barometer. This device accurately
measured the pressure of air and is still a key instrument in
understanding and forecasting weather systems\[3\]. From then to the
present day, many other instruments were invented to aid in weather
forecasting. The thermometer, anemometer, weather satellite, and weather
radar are some of these key tools. I hope that by the end of this
project, I can emulate a meteorologist by being able to accurately
(80%-90%) predict if it will rain with my model.

**3. Approach and Implementation**

My approach was to divide the project into three main steps/tasks that
must be completed: (1) Data Pre-processing, (2) Map-Reduce, and (3)
Testing Model.

**Data Pre-Processing**

This step was the most time consuming and important step to get right.
The goal of data pre-processing is to properly clean the dataset so it
can be usable and effective in modelling a model after it. With unclean
data, your machine learning algorithm will never be able to produce an
effective model.

> *Omitting Missing Values*

In order to clean the dataset, I first checked the number of missing
values in each independent variable and omitted every independent
variable containing over 50,000 missing entries. Next, I removed
non-numeric independent variables to simply the model as well as the
machine learning algorithm. Finally, any row containing a missing value
was omitted from the dataset.

*Figure 1*: R code for omitting missing values

> *Correlation*

The next step was to check for highly correlated variables and remove
them from the dataset. For determining correlation, I used the Pearson
method for finding the correlation coefficient. The larger the magnitude
of the correlation coefficient, the higher the correlation between the
two variables. In my case, there were a few highly correlated variables.
Minimum temperature and temperature at 9am were highly correlated with a
correlation coefficient of 0.90. Maximum temperature was also highly
correlated with temperature at 3pm; their correlation coefficient was
0.98. Although these variables were highly correlated, I did not omit
them from the dataset because I thought that they would be important for
the model.

> *Winsorization*

The next step was to figure out an effective way to deal with outliers.
Because nearly a third of my data was outliers, simply omitting them did
not seem like an option. I feared that I would not have enough data to
properly train and test the model. So instead, I used the method of
winsorization to limit the extreme values and mitigate the possibility
of outliers skewing the model. Essentially, if an outlier is greater
than the 3^rd^ quartile, then the outlier's value is set the value of
the 3^rd^ quartile. Likewise, if an outlier is less than the 1^st^
quartile, then the outlier's value is set to the value of the 1^st^
quartile. *Figure 4,* which shows the implementation of winsorization in
R, was repeated for every independent variable in the dataset containing
outliers. For a graphical representation of winsorization, see *Figure
5*.

> *Normalization*

The goal of normalization or normalizing the data is to change all of
numeric columns in the data set to a common scale. Before I normalized
my data, my logistic regression algorithm was inconsistent. This was due
to the scale of "pressure at 9am" and "pressure at 3pm" were much higher
than the rest of the dataset. When my logistic regression algorithm was
calculating weights, both pressure variables dominated the model. The
linear normalization formula was used to normalize each variable and
solve this issue.

*Figure 6*: Linear normalization formula
$$linear\ normalization = \ \frac{x - min(x)}{\max(x) - min(x)}$$

> *Creating Training and Testing Datasets*

The final step of data pre-processing is to create usable training and
testing datasets for the machine learning algorithm to use. To create
these datasets, I used a R function to randomize the rows of my
pre-processed dataset and assigned 60% of the randomized rows to a data
frame called "train.df", which will become the training dataset. I
assigned the remaining 40% to another data frame called "valid.df",
which will become the testing dataset. Then, I exported both files with
the comma-seperated values format so both datasets could then be read
within a Java program.

dataset

**Map-Reduce:**

Before I describe my approach and implementation of map-reduce within my
model, I first need to describe logistic regression.

> Logistic Regression
Logistic regression\[5\] is a machine learning algorithm that is perfect
for classifying a binary outcome. This is due to the sigmoid function,
which is the key behind the logistic regression algorithm. Essentially,
the sigmoid function takes a linear model and maps it between the values
of 0 and 1. It turns a linear function into probability. The formula for
the sigmoid function is as follows:

$$S(y) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{- y}}$$

where,

$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \ldots + \beta_{n}x_{n}$ (linear
function)

$$\beta = weight\ value$$

-   $x = independent\ variable\ (current\ data)$

When researching logistic regression, many sources mentioned logit or
log-odds. Logit is important because the sigmoid function can be derived
from it. The formula for the logit function is as follows:

$$logit(p) = ln(\frac{p}{1 - p})$$

where,

$$p = probability$$

$$\frac{p}{1 - p} = odds$$

The inverse of logit is equal to the sigmoid function, as shown below.

$${logit}^{- 1}(y) = \frac{e^{y}}{1 + e^{y}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{- y}}$$

> Map-Reduce Goal
The goal of map-reduce job is to train the model by using the training
dataset to calculate the weights for the model. After the map-reduce job
finishes, there will be a text file that contains the model's weights.
This text file will be used, along with the testing dataset, to test the
model and its performance.

> Mapper Class
The mapper class parses through the training dataset file, which is
determined in the configuration of the driver class. This is a super
important step because the data needs to extracted properly so that the
algorithm can correctly estimate and calculate the weights. The goal of
the mapper class is to utilize the sigmoid function, as well as a
learning rate, to update the weight of each independent variable within
the model. The formula that algorithm uses for calculating new weights
is shown below.\[1\]

$$new\ weight = old\ weight + (learning\ rate*(actual - predicted)*independent\ variable)$$

Each weight value calculation is sent to the reducer class as a \<key,
value\> pair of \<(Text) theta, (doubleWritable) weight calculation\>.
*Figure 9* is a snippet of code from my Mapper class that shows the use
of the new weight equation above as well as the use of the sigmoid
function.

*Figure 9*: Calculation of weights in Mapper class
![figure9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61329825/192900282-be4b8e39-b330-42e5-bc8b-78ef02ae4434.png)


After all of the mapper jobs are fully completed, the clean-up function
is then called which sends the intermediate \<key, value\> pairs to the
reducer class to handle.

*Figure 10*: Clean-up function
![figure10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61329825/192900319-1895fd17-6696-4832-86a4-49a8af09ba59.png)


> Reducer Class
The goal of the reducer class is to output the proper weight value of
each independent variable and write it to an output file. In my case,
this was done simply through summing all of the mapper jobs' values and
using the context.write(key, value) function to write it to an output
file.

*Figure 11*: Reduce function
![figure11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61329825/192900367-16ac2577-db3c-4c40-b7de-1052bb6ea1cd.png)


> Output of Map-Reduce Job
As mentioned before, the Map-Reduce job's goal was to train the model.
The output file contains the trained weights for the model which can be
used for testing in the future.

![figure12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61329825/192900422-b83ffd4a-1b26-40d7-a82b-8bc2b6bde06e.png)

The weights seem to be weighted correctly because the theta value with
the largest weight is theta7 which corresponds to the independent
variable "humidity at 3pm". If it will rain tomorrow, then the day
before would most likely have a high humidity. Inversely, the theta
value with the smallest weight is theta9 which corresponds to the
independent variable "pressure at 3pm". This makes sense because usually
high air pressure means fairer weather.

**Testing Model:**

To test the model, I created two separate Java classes. The first Java
class, called "TestingHadoop.java", parses both the testing dataset and
Map-Reduce output file, as well as, classifies and predicts each
instance of the testing dataset. The second Java class, called
"Instance.java", is a short class used for creating instances of the
dataset (where each instance holds the outcome of whether it will rain
tomorrow and an array of the data within that same row).

The following figures are snippets of code that show important functions
used for testing the model.

*Figure 13*: TestingHadoop.java code that shows use of sigmoid function
for classification
![figure13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61329825/192900461-9f9b15ed-9b8f-4ba9-8acf-139be3b4add7.png)



*Figure 14*: Instance.java

By testing the model in the way shown in *Figure 15* below*,* the
program can determine the number of predictions that were:

1.  Correct

2.  Wrong

3.  True Positive

4.  True Negative

5.  False Positive

6.  False Negative

These metrics are important for testing the effectiveness of the model
which will be shown in the next section.

**7. Experiment Results and Discussion**

To test the effectiveness of the model, I will use the confusion matrix
formulas of recall, precision, and accuracy. For each metric mentioned
in the previous section, their totals were:

![totals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61329825/192900602-33baa1e9-bb41-421a-baed-cd395bd97905.PNG)

> Recall

Recall measures the model's ability to find all of the relevant cases
within a dataset In layman's terms, "when it's actually yes, how often
does the model predict yes?"

$$Recall = \frac{true\ positives}{true\ positives + false\ negatives} = \frac{4373}{4373 + 1756} = 71.35\%$$

> Precision

Precision measures the model's ability to return only relevant instances
within a dataset. In layman's terms, "when it predicts yes, how often is
it correct?"

$$Precision = \frac{true\ positive}{true\ positive\  + \ false\ positive} = \frac{4373}{4373 + 6066} = 41.89\%$$

> Accuracy

Accuracy measures the how often the prediction is correct.

$$Accuracy = \frac{true\ positive + true\ negative}{total} = \frac{4373 + 35641}{47836} = 83.65\%$$

All of these statistical measures were researched and taken from \[4\].

Of these three statistical measures, precision did the weakest. Although
my model was quite accurate, it was not too great at predicting when it
will rain tomorrow. Instead, my model was very good at predicting when
it will not rain tomorrow. This is evident from the large number of true
negatives and small number of false negatives.

**4. Conclusion**

Possible Improvements

No model is perfect and my model is no exception. Here are a list of
possible changes and improvements that can increase the effectiveness of
the model.

> 1.  **Utilize dates to take into account seasons**. Currently my model
    does not take into account seasons. This is a big flaw because all
    of the seasons are different and have many different
    characteristics. If season was taken into account, then I believe
    the model would perform much better.

> 2.  **Figure out a way to include the non-numeric variables such as wind
    direction and location.** These variables were removed to simplify
    the model. These variables could be valuable within the model. For
    example, maybe a front that causes a storm always comes from the
    western coast of Australia and causes the wind direction to always
    blew in from the west. Another example could be that locations close
    to the shores of Australia experience rain at a more frequent rate
    compared to the inland locations.

> 3.  **There needs to be a greater balance in the number of rainTomorrow
    = "Yes" and rainTomorrow = "No" within the training dataset to
    properly expose the model to more instances of rainy conditions.** I
    fear that this happened in my model. It was not exposed to enough
    rainy days to learn what conditions caused rain.

**Conclusion**

This was a very fun project to work on. I learned so much in so many new
areas, such as R, Apache Hadoop, data cleaning, and machine learning
(with logistic regression) just to mention a few.
